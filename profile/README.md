It serves as a collaborative space for students, researchers, and industry, and holds the common chip design templates, code, and design files for the digital, analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits, as well as documentation and tutorials to guide users through the entire chip design flow. Explore the repository and join our growing community of future chip designers.
